# mudrep — CLI Tool

> **mudrep** is a terminal-based task automation and remote control tool that lets you record, schedule, and inject shell command sequences from a styled CLI interface — and control everything remotely through a Telegram bot.

---

## What Is It?

mudrep is a local command-line application built in Python. It runs in your terminal, and gives you a personal task manager where you can store groups of shell commands as named "tasks" and run them on demand, on a schedule, or when internet becomes available. It also ships a full Telegram bot integration so you can trigger and monitor everything from your phone or any device from anywhere else in the world only by access through internet.

## Features

### CLI Interface
- Two-line prompt showing your username and current path
- Coral orange color scheme (`#FF7F50`) throughout the interface
- Full shell passthrough — any system command works directly at the prompt
- Login and account system with password hashing (SHA-256)
- First-run registration flow for new users
- `clear` command redraws the full interface

### Task Management
- **record** — interactively record a sequence of shell commands as a named task
- **inject** — execute a saved task by name
- **list** — display all saved tasks in a formatted table
- **cat** — view the contents and metadata of a task
- **del** — delete a task and its file

### Task Triggers
- **none** — runs immediately when injected
- **internet** — runs automatically as soon as internet connectivity is detected (watchdog thread)
- **datetime** — runs at a scheduled date and time (format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`)

### Telegram Remote Control
- Full Telegram bot integration with password authentication
- Bot runs silently in the background — no logs shown in the terminal
- Control tasks and shell from your phone while the program runs on your machine
- `/stop` from Telegram cleanly exits remote mode without hanging the CLI
- Supports all task operations and shell commands remotely

## First Run — Account Setup

On the very first launch, mudrep will detect no existing users and guide you through creating your account:

```
=== Welcome to mudrep - First Time Setup ===
No accounts found. Please create your account.

Create username: meaghan

## Usage

### Recording a Task

```
record <name>
```

You will enter record mode and type commands one by one:

```
[RECORD MODE] Type commands one by one. Type 'exit' to finish.
record> mkdir -p ~/backups
record> cp -r ~/Documents ~/backups/docs
record> tar -czf ~/backups/docs.tar.gz ~/backups/docs
record> exit

Trigger Types:
  1. none     (run immediately)
  2. internet (run when internet available)
  3. datetime (run at a specific date/time)
Choose trigger (1/2/3): 1

[OK] Task 'backup' saved with 3 command(s).
```

### Running a Task

```
inject <recordname>
```

### Viewing All Tasks

```
list
```

### Viewing a Task's Contents

```
cat <recordname>
```

### Deleting a Task

```
del <recordname>
```

## Setting Up Telegram Remote Control

### Step 1 — Create a Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the instructions
3. Copy the bot token BotFather provides (format: `1234567890:ABCdef...`)

### Step 2 — Configure mudrep

At the mudrep prompt, type:

```
remote_setup
```

Enter your bot token and set a remote access password when prompted. This password protects your bot from unauthorized access.

### Step 3 — Start Remote Mode

```
remote
```

mudrep authenticates you, starts the bot silently in the background, and returns a prompt. Open Telegram, find your bot, and send `/start`. The bot will ask for your remote access password. Once authenticated, all commands are available.

To stop remote mode, type `exit` at the CLI prompt or send `/stop` from Telegram.

## Task Name Rules

Task names must:
- Contain only letters, numbers, underscores (`_`), or hyphens (`-`)
- Be between 1 and 64 characters long
- Not contain spaces, slashes, dots, or special characters

Valid examples: `backup`, `my-task`, `deploy_v2`

---

## Files Created by mudrep

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `mudrep_users.json` | Stores user accounts (hashed passwords) |
| `remote_config.json` | Stores bot token and remote password hash |
| `tasks.db` | SQLite database of all recorded tasks |
| `tasks/` | Folder containing task command files (`.txt`) |

## Project Structure

```
mudrep/
├── mudrep.py          # Main application file
├── mudrep_users.json  # Auto-generated on first run
├── remote_config.json # Auto-generated after remote_setup
├── tasks.db           # Auto-generated SQLite database
├── tasks/             # Auto-generated task files directory
└── README.md
```

---

## Security Notes

- All passwords are hashed with SHA-256 before storage — plain text passwords are never saved
- The Telegram bot requires password authentication before any command is accepted
- Only one Telegram user can be authorized at a time per session
- Remote mode must be explicitly started; the bot does not run automatically on launch

---

## Productivity Use Cases

- Automate repetitive multi-step terminal workflows into single commands
- Schedule maintenance scripts to run at a specific time without needing `cron`
- Run tasks as soon as a machine reconnects to the internet (internet trigger)
- Monitor and control your machine remotely from your phone via Telegram
- Quick task library for commands you use regularly but don't want to retype
